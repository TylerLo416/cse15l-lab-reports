# Remotely Connecting #
The first step is to install open-ssh client and open-ssh server. 
This is done by in the Optional Features Windows settings by clicking add a feature and finding open ssh.

Next step is to find your CSE15L account through this link: [link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)
Then in the VS code terminal, use the **ssh cs15lwi22???ieng5.ucsd.edu** with your personal CSE15L account and use your Student ID password.
